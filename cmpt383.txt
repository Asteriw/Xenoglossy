-Project Idea
--Calculation on the Web
---The main idea is to accept input from a user on a web page (Numbers, Operation, etc.), and return/display a result to the user. The languages used for this project will be Javascript, Python, and C++. The Javascript in the browser will communicate with Python, which will send off data to the C++ to perform the calculations, before returning it all back.
---A REST API built with Python will be used to communicate with the Javascript web page. The Python backend will use one of Boost.Python/SWIG to communicate with the C++.
-Deployment Technology: I will be using the Vagrant + Chef template.
